## Overview

This package includes several of the functions I use to analyze football data. More functions will be added as I get everything situated.

Currently, I just have functions to generated style/profile similarities between players, teams, and leagues. As this is the first time I'm publishing a package, I needed to start small.

## Installation

``` python
import Griffis_Soccer_Analysis as bg
```
