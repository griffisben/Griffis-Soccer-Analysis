## Overview

This package includes several of the functions I use to analyze football data. More functions will be added as I get everything situated.

Currently, I just have functions to generated style/profile similarities between players, teams, and leagues. As this is the first time I'm publishing a package, I needed to start small.

## Installation

To install the package, you can type this into you command line:

``` python
pip install Griffis-Soccer-Analysis
```

Here is an example of how to load the package.
``` python
import Griffis_Soccer_Analysis as bg
```

You don't need to load it as anything, so this will also load all functions:
``` python
import Griffis_Soccer_Analysis
```
